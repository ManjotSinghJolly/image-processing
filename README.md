# Image Processing Project

This project explores various image processing techniques using Python and OpenCV.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of image processing techniques for analysis and manipulation of digital images. The project covers tasks such as image loading, conversion to grayscale, resizing, filtering (blurring and sharpening), edge detection, flipping, and rotating images.

## Features

- Load and display images using OpenCV and Matplotlib.
- Convert images to grayscale.
- Resize images using different interpolation methods.
- Apply various image filtering techniques (blurring and sharpening).
- Detect edges in images using the Canny edge detection algorithm.
- Flip and rotate images.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (opencv-python)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ManjotSinghJolly/image-processing.git
   ```
